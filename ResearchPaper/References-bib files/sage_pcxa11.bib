    abstract = { The National Educational Longitudinal Study database was used to examine the educational development of students of low socioeconomic status (SES). A path analysis was conducted to determine the effects of student background, psychological, and behavioral variables on postsecondary educational attainment of low-SES students. The results show that high school math scores were the most powerful predictor of postsec-ondary educational attainment, followed by effects of academic expectations, locus of control, reading scores, problem behavior, and classroom behavior. Implications for school counselors are discussed. }
